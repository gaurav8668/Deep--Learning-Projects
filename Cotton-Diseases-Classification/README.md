<h3> The project is cotton disease classification. Dataset has 4 classes fresh cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, diseased cotton leaf. We are going to solve this problem using Deep Learning. Deep learning has the architecture like CNN that helps to extract the pattern from the images and helps to classify. </h3>

<h1> <b> Preprocessing of Data </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>We have reshaped the size of image, i.e (224, 224).</li>
    <li> We have done data augmentation like rescale, horizontal flip, shear etc. </li>
  </ul>
 
<h1> <b> Mode Creattion </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>We have trained the model on InceptionV3, ResNet50.</li>
    <li> We have got the good results on InceptionV3. </li>
  </ul>
